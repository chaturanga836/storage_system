- [x] **Query Interpreter**: Added new SQL/DSL parsing service using SQLGlot
- [x] **Demo Modernization**: Created microservices-ready demonstration scripts

### ✅ Service Implementation
- [x] **Auth Gateway** (8080) - JWT authentication, API gateway, RBAC
- [x] **Tenant Node** (8000) - Core data processing, storage, indexing
- [x] **Operation Node** (8081) - Tenant coordination, auto-scaling
- [x] **CBO Engine** (8082) - Cost-based query optimization, ML-enhanced
- [x] **Metadata Catalog** (8083) - Metadata management, auto-compaction
- [x] **Query Interpreter** (8085) - SQL/DSL parsing, query transformation
- [x] **Monitoring** (8084) - Observability, health checks, metrics

### ✅ Infrastructure & Tooling
- [x] **Docker Compose**: Multi-service orchestration with production-ready configuration
- [x] **Service Scripts**: Automated start/stop/cleanup scripts for development
- [x] **Demo Scripts**: Three comprehensive demo scripts showcasing different aspects
- [x] **Documentation**: Complete documentation overhaul with microservices focus

## 🔮 Future-Ready Features

### Repository Separation Ready
Each service is designed for easy extraction into independent repositories:
```bash
git subtree push --prefix=auth-gateway origin auth-gateway-repo
git subtree push --prefix=tenant-node origin tenant-node-repo
# ... etc for each service
```

### Production Deployment Ready
- **Docker Compose**: Ready for container orchestration
- **Kubernetes**: Service definitions ready for K8s
- **Load Balancing**: NGINX configuration examples provided
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus/Grafana integration ready

### CI/CD Ready
- **Service-specific builds**: Each service can be built independently
- **Independent deployments**: Services can be deployed separately
- **Testing isolation**: Services can be tested in isolation

---

## 🎉 Migration Success!

The multi-tenant hybrid storage system has been successfully transformed from a monolithic architecture to a modern microservices architecture. The system is now:

- **Scalable**: Services can be scaled independently
- **Maintainable**: Clean separation of concerns
- **Reliable**: Fault-tolerant with service isolation
- **Observable**: Comprehensive monitoring and logging
- **Future-proof**: Ready for independent repository separation

The migration preserves all core functionality while adding advanced features like SQL parsing, cost-based optimization, and intelligent auto-scaling.

**Next Steps**: Run the demo scripts to explore the new architecture and refer to the comprehensive documentation for development and deployment guidance.
