# Cost-Based Optimizer (CBO) Engine

A sophisticated query optimization service that analyzes query patterns and provides optimal execution plans.

## Features

- Cost-based query planning
- Statistics collection and analysis
- Machine learning-based optimization
- Execution plan caching
- Performance monitoring

## Architecture

The CBO Engine is designed as a standalone microservice that can be deployed independently and serves optimization requests from multiple tenant nodes.

## Key Components

- `query_optimizer.py` - Main CBO implementation
- `cost_models.py` - Cost estimation models
- `statistics_collector.py` - Statistics collection service
- `plan_cache.py` - Execution plan caching

## API

The CBO Engine exposes both REST and gRPC APIs for optimization requests.

## Dependencies

- Machine learning libraries (scikit-learn, etc.)
- Statistics collection utilities
- Shared protobuf definitions
